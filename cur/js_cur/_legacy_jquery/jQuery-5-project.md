# jQuery 5 project
Create a javascript ONLY version of youTube, where all the searches lead to javascript topic (when possible) for example if I want to find a video about while loops, instead of having to write “javascript while loop” I can just  write “while loop” and I still get the expected results.


## **REQUIREMENTS** 
1. You must use the youtube API
2. it needs to have a search input and button
3. the search needs to be triggered either with button click or pressing enter.
4. on page load it needs to load some default videos, javascript related
5. all search must find javascript only related videos (or none)
6. you need to be able to sort the videos by date, rating, relevance, title
7. You need to be able to filter the video y their length for example only showing video less than 4 minutes long or only over 4 minutes and so on…
