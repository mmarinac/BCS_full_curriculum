----------

Create a todo app according to the following requirements:
it needs to have a input field.
it needs to have a submit button
you need to be able to submit pressing the button but also pressing enter.
you need to be able to mark todos as done with a line through or something as obvious.
you need to be able to remove todo clicking on a trashcan icon or something as obvious
the delete icon needs to be hidden until hovering on the todo.
the user needs to be able to sort the todos by dragging and dropping them around.
(look into jQuery UIâ€¦)
You need to have this in github from the very beginning and keep it up to date so that we can check your progress from your repo.
