# Hosting your static websites with GitHub Pages

With GitHub Pages it's easy to deploy/host your static websites and make them available online so you can use them to host your portfolio or CV pages for example. 

1. Initialize new git project in the root folder of your website. 

2. Create a repo on GitHib and add a remote origin to your local project. 

3. Make sure that your homepage is called index.html, it's the default entry point for any static website.

4. Push all the code to your GitHub repo. 

5. Go to 'Settings' of your repo and scroll down to GitHub Pages section. 

6. Select 'master branch'; the changes would be saved and you will see a link to your hosted version.

7. After a few minutes your website would be available via this link.
