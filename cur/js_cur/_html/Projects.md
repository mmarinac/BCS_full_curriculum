# Cloning Projects

> Cloning implies recreating the layout with HTML and CSS, no functionality. Try to stay away from the libraries like Bootstrap, just go with the CSS Grid or Flexbox.

Cloning projects are to be pushed to GitLab for us to see and give feedback.

These HTML/CSS projects will help you to practice using CSS for all kinds of layout.

Please take the `01_html_css` folder outside of you `BCS_JS_BOOTCAMP_FILES_TDD` to not have nested git projects. And then you will have 6 folders for 6 cloning projects, each would be initialized as git. Do commits often and push your code to gitlab/github so we can see the result, progress and give feedback.

Please start with HTML only first, feel free to refer to the [HTML reference page](./js_cur/_html/HTML5) and CSS section where every block has it's own video lesson.

This video is following the process of creating a clone of a portfolio page from scratch and might help you to understand how to "see" the structure of the page just by looking at it. Recommended to watch if you are not quite sure how to complete a project from start to finish.

This video will help you to get familiar with using Terminal to work with the file system, i.e. how to create/remove/move files and folders and navigate through your file system via the command line.

<details>
    <summary>Mac/Linux/GitBash most used terminal commands</summary>

To go to some folder:

    cd path_to_a_target_directory_(folder)

To go one level up in the folder hierarchy:

    cd ..

To see a list of folders and files in the current folder:

    ls

And to see them with hidden folders/files run

    ls -a

To create a new folder:

    mkdir name_of_a_new_folder

To create a new file in the current folder:

    touch filename

To remove a file:

    rm filename

To remove a folder:

    rm -rf folder_name

To find and remove specific instances of folders inside current folder:

    rm -rf `find . -type d -name folder_name`

or

    find . -name NAME_OF_A_FOLDER -exec rm -rf {} \;

## Cloning Project #1

**Create a single-page responsive website with the following elements (the content could be anything, just the layout should be the same):**

-   [ðŸ‘‰ Take a look at the example of such a website ðŸ‘ˆ](https://res.cloudinary.com/gk3000/image/upload/v1572367458/single-page-workshop_barcelona-code-school.jpg), it's one page which takes the full width of the screen
-   Navigation on top with links to different section of the same webpage
-   Header section with image background and Title, Subtitle and Call to action element on top of it
-   Contact us section with embedded Google Map
-   Responsive image gallery with images resizing/reorganizing based on the width of the screen
-   Brands section which is a responsive grid of images with text below each one
-   Team section with portraits and captions for the team members
-   Footer section
-   Take a look at the [example of pure CSS dropdown menu](https://codepen.io/GK3000/pen/eYOeVWM)
-   A video example of the original website to be cloned: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMRaRBrJpbA

> It's a good idea to create a git repo for your cloning projects and start committing/pushing the progress to GitLab.

## Cloning Project #2

**Refactor previous project to make it a multi-page website**

-   Make every section of the webpage to be a separate page (a separate HTML file), so you will have something like:

    * index.html with the home page (the splash screen)
    * location.html with the Location section and a map
    * team.html with images of the team
    * brands.html with the content of the brands section
    * gallery.html with the gallery images

-   Every page should have the topbar with navigation and the footer
-   Here is an example of what it should look like: http://dear-beer-w-pages.surge.sh/

You donâ€™t need to create any functionality, just purely presentational copy of all the page elements.

## Portfolio page

> This portfolio page could be used for actual job hunt after the course and eventually you will fill it up with the projects you will do during the bootcamp. If you are not looking into getting a developer's job or already have a portfolio page you are going to use feel free to skip to the next cloning project.

Examples of portfolios done by our previous students:

http://josharnott.surge.sh

http://annachew.surge.sh

https://yenhoang_portfolio.surge.sh/

https://saramoya.gitlab.io/my-portfolio/

http://gerviebarczyk.com/

https://gabriellatavares.surge.sh/

The visual design is completely up to you.

## Cloning Project #3: Lights Out Challenge

**Weather app clone (static page, no functionality)**

The goal of this exercise is to focus on understanding the structure and planning the HTML first before coding. To do so, try to recreate this page without checking the results in the browser before completing it. 

First analyze the screenshot and decide on the structure and CSS solution to position elements where they supposed to be. Then add the HTML code for the layout and apply CSS. Remember to link your CSS file to your HTML file. 

Here is is the repo to use as a boilerplate with the icons: https://gitlab.com/gk3000/light_out_weather_app. To get it first click the "Fork" button to copy it into your GitLab account and then clone it to your laptop by selecting "Clone" button --> copy the URL and in the Terminal run `git clone URL_YOU_COPIED`. This will download all the files and to push it back once done you will need to run only these 3 commands:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'done'
git push
```

> Make the main container for this page with limited set width of 600px so it will not stretch across the screen.
