Lines can be named on the grid when creating the track listing in grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns. Lines are named inside square brackets, and the name can be anything that you choose other than the word span.

	.grid {
	  display: grid;
	  grid-template-columns: [kiwi] 1fr 1fr 1fr [banana] 1fr;
	}

	.item {
	  grid-column: kiwi / banana;
	}
