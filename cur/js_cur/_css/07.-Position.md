## What is CSS Positioning?

What the position property does is to change the way elements behave in terms of the document flow.

When we talk about document flow we are describing the way elements place themselves in the document. For example if we have a document with a paragraph, an image and then two more paragraphs and have done nothing to change the flow it will display in the browser like this.

![Example of document flow in the browser](https://thecssworkshop.com/perch/resources/document-flow-w900.png)


Here is the code for the example:

    <div class="wrapper">
    
    <p>Posuere varius ullamcorper ipsum adipiscing dignissim ipsum adipiscing a a quisque malesuada quam purus venenatis sagittis fermentum parturient curabitur montes a metus. Facilisis id litora eu mi a at lobortis odio vestibulum adipiscing conubia parturient scelerisque tempor nec cras adipiscing nam interdum. </p>
    
    <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/silent/images/3/3b/Walkinsh.jpg" alt="silent hill">
    
    <p>Felis taciti mus penatibus etiam leo sodales condimentum et purus in urna suspendisse rutrum dictum metus semper dis. Parturient a a a blandit facilisi id eu porta ultricies vestibulum vestibulum mi etiam a. </p>
    
    <p>Dictumst proin blandit consectetur suspendisse a et ut egestas tempus a scelerisque ultricies nam inceptos habitasse fusce ut nascetur elementum arcu ut vehicula id aliquet penatibus. Mollis ad a odio cum diam a diam mauris magnis sapien consectetur ad a faucibus accumsan justo.</p>
    </div>

Normal document flow places items one after another as they appear in the source.

The normal document flow places the items one after another and the browser space out the paragraphs.

The `position` property can take one of five values:

    static
    relative
    absolute
    fixed
    sticky

The initial keyword value is `static`. This is the default and is what is set on all elements that have no other position applied. All of the elements in the example above have `position: static` as their initial value, without us adding that to any rules.


# Relative positioning

Using relative positioning we can change how an element is positioned *relative* to **where it would have been in the document flow**. 

If we give the image in the previous example a position property set to `relative` nothing will change until we also add one or more of the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` properties. These take a length unit as a value.

    img {
      width: 200px;
      position: relative;
      left: 20px;
      top: 60px;
    }

This moves the image from its natural left position 20 pixels and down from the top 60 pixels. 

The element will overlap other elements that it now touches, the other elements on the page do not know about the changes to the positioning of this element so they continue in document flow. 

When you use position: relative **the document layout is maintained** - you can see how we now have a gap above the image where it has been pushed down.

![Example of relative positioning](https://thecssworkshop.com/perch/resources/relative-positioning-w900.png)


In this example the image has been pushed down 20 pixels and in from the left 20 pixels.
So, relative positioning can be used to push elements around from their regular position in the document.

# Absolute positioning

Absolute positioning positions an item relative to the viewport or the next parent element that has positioning context. Continue using the example code to follow along.

If you change the image in our example document to `position: absolute` you can see that the space it took up collapses. The element is said to have been **removed from the document flow**.

The left and top values are now positioning the item relative to the viewport. As the viewport is now the containing block. Drag your browser window small and the text will end up underneath the image.

    img {
      position: absolute;
      top:20px;
      left: 60px;
    }

The viewport is now the containing block for our image.

**Positioning context**
The reason that the image is positioned relative to the viewport is that the viewport is the containing block, and there are no other elements creating a positioning context.

We can create positioning context for our element however. A common scenario would be to have a wrapper around the content of the website with auto margins in order that the wrapper is centered in the viewport. However unless the wrapper can be a containing block, our absolutely positioned image will ignore it too.

To create positioning context using the wrapper we need to position the wrapper. We donâ€™t want to actually change how it displays or remove it from normal document flow. To position an element but not change anything about it we can add `position: relative` with no other positioning properties. It now becomes the positioning context for our image - the image now positions relative to the top and left corner of the wrapper element.

    .wrapper {
      margin: 0 auto;
      width: 640px;
      position: relative;
    }
    
    img {
      position: absolute;
      top:20px;
      left: 60px;
    }
![The image inside wrapper](https://thecssworkshop.com/perch/resources/absolute2-w900.png)


The image is now positioned using the wrapper div as the container.

While you probably wonâ€™t often want to position an image over your content in this manner, absolute positioning can become useful when creating smaller parts of your UI. For example you might want to position a logo in your header relative to the header wrapper. It works best in places where the dimensions of the container and elements inside are known, as otherwise you run into issues of content overlapping.

# Fixed positioning

Using `position: fixed` enables us to **fix an element relative to the viewport** while the rest of the content scrolls as normal. Continue using the example file from the last lesson to follow along.

If you change `position: absolute` on your image to `position: fixed` it will hop back to the top left corner of the viewport, you can push it around the viewport by changing the top, left, bottom or right values.

The difference between `position: absolute` and `position: fixed` becomes apparent when you scroll. A **fixed element stays in the same place relative to the viewport and the content scrolls** under it.

# Sticky positioning

The positioning methods we have explored so far enjoy excellent browser support and can be safely used in your layouts. There is a newer method starting to have support in browsers that achieves an effect that up to now has required JavaScript. Using `position: sticky` acts as if you have used position: relative on an element *until* the user scrolls past a threshold at which point it acts like position: fixed.

The final value of the position property that we will take a look at does not enjoy such good browser support but is worth exploring as it can be polyfilled using JavaScript and is likely to be something that we can take advantage of in the future.

Using Chrome or Firefox you can see position: sticky in action by changing the image to have the following CSS rules.

    img {
      position: sticky;
      top: 0px;
    }

Now as you scroll up the image stays in document flow until it hits the top of the viewport at which point it will act like a fixed element. The offset value of `top` is relative to the viewport.

The sticky value of the position property also currently works in Safari with a WebKit prefix, so if you add `position: -webkit-sticky` to your rules you have more browser coverage.


    img {
      position: -webkit-sticky;
      position: sticky;
      top: 0px;
    }
