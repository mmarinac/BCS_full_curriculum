The `minmax` track sizing function means that you can set a minimum and a maximum size for a track. A good use for this function is to create row tracks that appear to be a fixed height, but expand when taller content is added. In the below example, rows created in the implicit grid will always be at least 200 pixels tall, but will expand to auto therefore growing large enough for taller content.

	.grid {
	  display: grid;
	  grid-auto-rows: minmax(200px, auto);
	}
