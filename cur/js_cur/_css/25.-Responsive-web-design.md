# Responsive web design

Responsive design is about creating layouts that will work well on a variety of devices - from a high resolution desktop right down to a mobile phone. 

## Defining the viewport

If we are creating a responsive design then most of the time we will be concerned about the user’s viewport. The viewport is the area of your page that the user can currently see - the area inside the browser window  or viewable when they look at their phone.

If you use vh (viewport height) or vw (viewport width) units in CSS these allow you to change the size and positioning of elements based on the size of the viewport.

If we intend our design to be responsive, and to change according to the viewport of the user, we need to make sure that their browser is aware of this. We do this by adding a meta tag to the `head` section of your html file.

	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

This meta tag tells the device to set the width of the page to the screen width of the device, and the initial zoom level on loading to 1. If you do not add this tag then you will most likely find your site zoomed out on mobile devices showing the full-width layout which will make it hard to read.

## Media queries

We use them to change CSS styles for selected elements based on (most often) screensize of the user's device. For example, the following media queries change the color of `h1` element:

	@media screen and (min-width:460px) {
	  h1 {
	    color: blue;
	  }
	}

	@media screen and (min-width:660px) {
	  h1 {
	    color: red;
	  }
	}

	@media screen and (min-width:960px) {
	  h1 {
	    color: green;
	  }
	}

This example will hide footer from mobile phones:

	@media screen and (max-width:460px) {
	  footer {
	    display: none;
	  }
	}

Media Queries really don’t get a lot more complex than this, however we are not limited to detecting screen sizes. We can detect a large number of features of the device being used including:

+width
+height
+device-width
+device-height
+orientation
+aspect-ratio
+device-aspect-ratio
+color
+color-index
+monoChrome
+resolution
+scan
+grid

## Images

The simple solution to make sure that the images are not going to break your layout is to limit the maximum width, so they could display smaller than 100% of a container but never larger. You could do it on a global level for all the images:

	img {
	  max-width: 100%;
	}

Another feature let's you to load the same image in several different versions. Here for the smallest devices I show a tiny image version, then we have a medium version of the image for devices with slightly larger screen and full size image for large screens.

You can also see that the final element inside picture is just a regular image tag - and this is what will display if the browser does not support picture.

	<picture>
	  <source media="(max-width: 400px)" srcset="responsive-image-crop.jpg">
	  <source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="responsive-image-small.jpg">
	  <img src="responsive-image-large.jpg" alt="Balloons">
	</picture>

## Browsers support

If you are redesigning an existent website then you could use it's Google Analytics data to see what kind of audience you have in a sense of the browsers they are using. For example, if your website attracts a substantial number of users with old Internet Explorer browsers make sure to use CSS supported by this browser.

If you are developing a new website and have no idea about kind of audience you will have it would be a safe approach to begin with bulletproof 'older' CSS and on top of that build a set of more 'modern' CSS rules for the modern browsers to support. 

Make sure to check [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com) website if you are in doubts. CSS Grid, for example, is not supported in many older browsers. 

If a browser doesn’t understand a CSS property or value it will simply ignore it. This is very useful as it means we can very often write CSS for older browsers and then add some newer CSS to enhance the experience. This needs testing of course, as sometimes the properties you set for older browsers will also effect the behaviour of the newer CSS.

As a simple example back in the module on the display property we created a cards layout using `display: inline-block`. This worked quite well to cope with uneven amounts of content however our boxes did not stretch to the height of the tallest. So we've had a 2 rows with 3 cards in each and their height was different based on the amount of content they had.

We can enhance the display for newer browser by making the container `.wrapper` a flex container.

	.wrapper {
	  width: 660px;
	  margin: 0 auto;
	  display: flex;
	  flex-wrap: wrap;
	}

Our items now stretch to full height. On an older browser the visitor would just get the uneven boxes. It wouldn’t be a disaster and they wouldn’t know about the finessed layout.

## Mobile first

Every time we design a new website we should remember that it can be viewed with hundreds of possible devices/screen sizes. It can be viewed via screen reader, it could be magnified by the user, it could be printed out, etc. 

One of the trending approaches now is called 'mobile first' meaning that you start building your website with a small screen preview in the browser. This is important to organize your HTML properly in a sense of organizing DOM in the order it would be displayed on the mobile devices. It's important to understand that semantic markup and logical order of you elements lays a foundation to your website and you do not try to fix the DOM from the CSS part.
