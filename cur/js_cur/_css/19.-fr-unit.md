# The "fr" unit


When defining your grid with `grid-template-columns` or `grid-template-rows` you can use any length unit for your track sizing, you can also use a new unit designed for grid - the `fr` unit. This unit describes a fraction of the available space in the grid container.

The following track listing would distribute an equal part of available space to each track.

	.grid {
	  display: grid;
	  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
	}

This next track listing would distribute two parts of available space to track one, and one part to each of the other two tracks.

	.grid {
	  display: grid;
	  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
	}

This final example shows how fixed length tracks can be combined with flexible tracks.

	.grid {
	  display: grid;
	  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 1fr;
	}
