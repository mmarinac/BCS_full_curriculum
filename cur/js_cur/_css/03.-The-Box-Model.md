## What is the Box Model?

Any element on your page is inside a rectangular box. If you add a border to any element you can see the boxes. The box model defines how that box behaves. For example does the element have padding between the content and the border or a margin between it and the next box?
Everything we do in the rest of the course relies on understanding the box model, so this is a very good place to start.

## Whatâ€™s in a box?

A box consists of:

- a **margin**: the space between the visible area of the box and other elements.
- a **border**: marking the outer edge of the visible box.
- **padding**: pushing the box content away from the border.
- **content**: the actual content of the box.

We will be exploring how margins, padding and borders work in later lessons in this module.

# The standard Box Model

The standard box model is as defined in the CSS2.1 specification. The size you specify in your CSS for an element is the size of the content box. Then the padding, border and margin are added onto that width.
This behavior is often confusing for new developers. It seems reasonable to expect that the width given to an element should be the visible size of the element on the page, yet this is not the case.



# The Alternate Box Model

The CSS Basic Interface Module Level 3 defines [two possible box models](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-3/#box-sizing).

- **content-box**: matches the CSS2.1 box model. The width is taken from the content box, and is the standard box model we looked at in the last lesson.
- **border-box**: a new box model, taking the width from the box created by the border.

The border-box box model takes the size that you specify on the element and the border and padding then push the content area inwards. If you define a box of 300 pixels it then takes up 300 pixels on the screen, the actual content will be smaller than that if you have added a border and padding.

**Switching on the alternate box model**
The `content-box` model is the default. Unless you choose to use the alternate model any width that you specify on a box will define the width of the content, padding and borders will the be added to create the actual width.

To use the `border-box` version of the box model add `box-sizing: border-box` to the CSS rules of the element that you want to use this alternate model. 

You can toggle the sizing on individual elements or you can add CSS that will switch on the alternate box model for all elements. You could do this very simply using the Universal Selector `*`.


    * { 
    box-sizing: border-box; 
    }

Iâ€™d suggest instead however that you take a look at [the inheritance method described on CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/inheriting-box-sizing-probably-slightly-better-best-practice/). 

    html {
     box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    
    *, *:before, *:after {
      box-sizing: inherit;
    }

By using this CSS you can make all elements use the alternate box model, but any third party component added to your page that expects the default box model can continue to use that model.

**Browser support for the alternate box model**
The alternate box model is supported in [all modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css3-boxsizing) and right back to Internet Explorer 8. So there really is no reason not to use it. Youâ€™ll find it used throughout this course and we would suggest that in most cases, it is the best option and will save you a lot of trouble and maths!
