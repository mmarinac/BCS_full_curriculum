# Making a responsive Grid without media queries

When we define Grid we can let it calculate how many columns and rows it needs to display our content properly and it will readjust based on the viewport size accordingly to fit in all the items. 

By doing that we can avoid using media queries with predefined break points To achieve that we are going to use `auto-fit` and `minmax`. For example, for the `grid-template-columns` we will say:

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
```

So instead of saying how many times we want to repeat a certain column with we are saying to repeat as many as needed to fit the available space (`auto-fit`) and for the width of the column instead of saying a width specifically we are using `min-max` to say that minimum width of the column should be 300px and maximum could be one fraction. So on smaller screens we will have one column and on bigger screens we will have an unknown number of columns with a width equal to 300px.

## Example:

### HTML:
```html
<div class='gridContainer'>
<figure>
  <img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="random">
    
  </figure>
  <figure><img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="random"></figure>
  <figure><img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="random"></figure>
  <figure><img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="random"></figure>
  <figure><img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="random"></figure>
  </figure>
  <figure><img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="random"></figure>
</div>
```

### CSS:
```css
.gridContainer {
  display: grid;
  /* in the next line we define auto number of columns to fit as many of them as possible (auto-fit) with minimum width of the column to be 250px and maximum 1 fraction minmax(250px, 1fr). If you will resize the browser window you will see that Grid is changing the number of columns as per instructions above*/
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-template-rows: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap:1em;
}
```
