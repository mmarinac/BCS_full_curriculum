# Reset

Resetting CSS styles is a way to make sure that your website is not affected by **different** default styling coming from different browsers. 

For example, one browser has margins around `body` and another doesn't. So resetting CSS would be a good way to prevent it.

One of the most famous CSS resets comes from the industry expert Eric Meyer.

	html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe,
	h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre,
	a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code,
	del, dfn, em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp,
	small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var,
	b, u, i, center,
	dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li,
	fieldset, form, label, legend,
	table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td,
	article, aside, canvas, details, embed, 
	figure, figcaption, footer, header, hgroup, 
	menu, nav, output, ruby, section, summary,
	time, mark, audio, video {
		margin: 0;
		padding: 0;
		border: 0;
		font-size: 100%;
		font: inherit;
		vertical-align: baseline;
	}
	/* HTML5 display-role reset for older browsers */
	article, aside, details, figcaption, figure, 
	footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, section {
		display: block;
	}
	body {
		line-height: 1;
	}
	ol, ul {
		list-style: none;
	}
	blockquote, q {
		quotes: none;
	}
	blockquote:before, blockquote:after,
	q:before, q:after {
		content: '';
		content: none;
	}
	table {
		border-collapse: collapse;
		border-spacing: 0;
	}

If you prefer super minimalist approach you can just do this to get rid of unwanted margins and paddings:

	* {
	  padding: 0;
	  margin: 0;
	}

# Normalize.css

Normalize attempted to take a fresh look at everything which could be affected by the browsers default styling and ignore everything else which has nothing to normalize about. The whole idea of Normalize is not to **reset** but to bring all the styles across different browsers to the same look.
