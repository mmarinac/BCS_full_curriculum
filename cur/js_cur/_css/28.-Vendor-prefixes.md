# Vendor prefixes

You might want to use vendor prefixes to target some specific browsers (especially older ones) to make sure that your CSS works properly with them.

Each browser has a vendor prefix.

* -webkit-: Android, Chrome, iOS, Safari
* -ms-: Internet Explorer
* -moz-: Firefox
* -o-: Opera

If we take Flexbox as an example, the standard value of the display property to make an element a flex container is:

	display: flex;

If you wanted to ensure you supported older versions of Safari you might also write:

	display: -webkit-flex;
	display: flex;

Prefixes can be used on properties as well as values

	-webkit-flex-direction: column;
	flex-direction: column;
