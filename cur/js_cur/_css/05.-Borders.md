The border goes around your element, you can wrap a border around each side or just some of the sides. For a seemingly simple thing there are a large number of border related properties.
**The border-* properties.**
Borders have been around since CSS 1, the up to date specification for border is in the CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3.
Iâ€™m going to begin with the shorthand and work up from there with border. If you wanted to add a 2 pixel, black border on all sides of your element you could use:

    .box {
      border: 2px solid #000;
    }

The `border` shorthand applies the same border to all sides of the element. To add that border to just one side, the top we can use a different shorthand:

    .box {
      border-top: 2px solid #000;
    }

For the other sides you can use:

    border-right
    border-bottom
    border-left

These are shorthands for three different properties. If we take `border-top` as an example, this is shorthand for:

    border-top-width
    border-top-style
    border-top-color

The `border-top-width` property takes any positive length unit, you can also use a keyword value of thin, medium or thick. You canâ€™t have a negative sized border.
The `border-top-style` property takes one of a number of different style keywords. 

    none
    hidden
    dotted
    dashed
    solid
    double
    groove
    ridge
    inset
    outset
    inherit

It is fairly unusual for me to use anything other than `none`, `solid`, `dotted` or `dashed` however you can take a look at the other values if they achieve an effect you need. Note that the specification doesnâ€™t precisely define things like the spacing between dots in `dotted` so you should check in different browsers to make sure it renders as you expect.
Finally, `border-top-color` takes a colour value. This can be any valid CSS colour value - hex, RGB, RGBa, named colours, HSL or HSLa.
**Other border properties**
In order to add rounded corners to a border you can use the `border-radius` property. Once again this is a shorthand for four properties, one for each corner:

    border-top-left-radius
    border-top-right-radius
    border-bottom-right-radius
    border-bottom-left-radius

The values for the border-radius properties are length or percentages, creating a circular border (if using one value) or an elliptical border (if using two values).
To round all four corners 10 pixels:

    .box {
      border: 2px solid #333;
      border-radius: 10px;
    }

To round just the top corners 10 pixels:

    .box {
      border-top-left-radius: 10px;
      border-top-right-radius: 10px;
    }

To create elliptical borders on all four corners:

    .box {
      border-radius: 60px / 30px;
    }
