The selectors in the CSS Level 3 Selectors specification are powerful and well supported by browsers. In order to truly master CSS layout we need to have a good understanding of how to select parts of our document.

---

# Basic selectors

## Element Selectors

The most basic of the selectors is an _element selector_. For example, paragraphs in an HTML document are represented by the `p` element and wrapped in `<p></p>` tags. To select all paragraphs in a document we would use the following selector.

```css
p {
}
```

To select all level 1 headings we would use the `h1` selector.

```css
h1 {
}
```

Element selectors will apply CSS to every instance of that element in your document.

## Class Selectors

An element selector is just fine if you want all of your headings or paragraphs in a document to have the style. What if instead you want some items to differ from the main style? Here you could use a _class selector_.

In HTML we add a class to an element, like this:

```html
<p class="box">Content here</p>
```

In our CSS we can use the class selector, it starts with a `.` character.

```css
.box {
}
```

You might sometimes see the class added to the element in the CSS, like this:

```css
p.box {
}
```

This will work, but we would suggest you avoid doing this as you might not always want the styles set up for `.box` to be used on a paragraph element. By creating the rules for `.box` without being specific about `.box` being a paragraph we could reuse this rule for any element, not just paragraphs.

```html
<p class="box">Content here</p>
<div class="box">Content here</div>
```

You can add your class to multiple items in one HTML document, and the selector will select all of them and apply the same styles to each.

## ID Selectors

Another way to pick out one element is to give it an ID in the markup.

```html
<p id="box">Content here</p>
```

In the CSS we select an ID using the `#` character.

```css
#box {
}
```

An ID can only be used once per document, therefore would not be an ideal choice for our class of `.box` which we might want to reuse on several elements. An ID also gives the element higher specificity, which can make it difficult to overwrite the styles later.

Therefore in the interest of creating reusable CSS, we would suggest avoiding styling based on an ID. If your element has an ID applied for other reasons, you can still add a class and apply your CSS via the class selector.

## Applying same styles to several selectors:

Let's say we want to make the headings of all levels red:

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  color: red;
}
```

# Combinators

## Descendant Selector

_Select all elements that are descendants of a specified parent._

When you use a descendant selector you can specify a parent selector and then the element that you wish to style. So if we have markup like this:

```html
<p>Content here</p>
<div class="box">
  <p>Content inside the box class.</p>
</div>
```

If we were to select the p element with an element selector that would style both the paragraphs - the one inside the div with a class of box as well as the one outside. To only style the p inside .box we use a descendant selector.

```css
.box p {
}
```

Here `.box` is the specified parent and p is the selector inside that parent that we are going to apply CSS styles to.

You can have more than one descendant in the list. For example, only selecting li elements that are children of a `ul` element inside a parent with a class of box.

```css
.box ul li {
}
```

The above selector would not select an li element if it were inside an `ol`. With long chains of selectors you again can fall into the trap of making CSS that is very hard to reuse. If your selectors get more than three elements deep that often indicates there would be a better way to structure your CSS.

## Applying same styles to several descendant selectors:

Let's say we want to make the headings of all levels red but only if they are inside `section` tag. Instead of writing :

```css
section h1,
section h2,
section h3,
section h4,
section h5,
section h6 {
  color: red;
}
```

We can use `:is()` pseudo-class:

```css
section :is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {
  color: red;
}
```

## Child Selector

_Select all elements that are immediate children of a specified parent_

The descendant selector will target all children, even if there are other elements in-between the parent and child. For example if we take the following markup:

```html
<div class="items">
  <p>Item One</p>
  <p>Item Two
    <div>
      <p>Item 2a</p>
      <p>Item 2b</p>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>Item Three</p>
</div>
```

If we used a descendant selector:

```css
.items p {
}
```

This would select all `p` items, those nested inside the first `div` and those inside the `div` nested inside the `p` for item two. If we instead use a child selector:

```css
.items > p {
}
```

This will only select the `p` elements that are a direct child of `.items`. If there is another element in-between then the `p` will not be selected.

## Adjacent Sibling

_Select elements that are the adjacent siblings of an element_

The adjacent sibling selector is a useful selector that enables the selection of an element when it is next to another element. This is how we can deal with things like stacked headings in CSS.

A common request is to make the paragraph that comes directly after a heading different in some way, to make it stand out. That can be achieved with an adjacent sibling, the following selector selects the p element only when it comes after an h2.

```css
h2 + p {
}
```

You can of course combine these. If you only want this to happen for content inside a wrapper with a class of `.box` you can combine a descendant selector with the adjacent sibling.

```css
.box h2 + p {
}
```

The above selector will only select a p element that comes after an h2 element where both are inside something with a class of .box.

## General Sibling

_Select elements that are the siblings of an element_

The general sibling selector works in a similar way to adjacent sibling but will select all siblings that come after the specified element - even if they are not adjacent to each other. This selector was added in Level 3 of the Selectors module.
If we want to select all p elements that come after an h2 we would use:

```css
h2 ~ p {
}
```

This would select paragraphs but not headings, lists or anything else.

# Attribute Selectors

Some HTML elements have attributes. For example to create a link we use the `a` element with an `href` attribute, the value of the `href` is the link the browser will follow when clicked.

```html
<a href="http://google.com">Google</a>
```

Form fields make heavy use of attributes. For example, the input element uses the type attribute to indicate whether the field is for text, an email address or even a checkbox.

```html
<input type="text" name="fName" id="fName" />
<input type="email" name="fEmail" id="fEmail" />
<input type="checkbox" name="fTerms" id="fTerms" value="true" />
```

Attribute selectors give us the ability to target an element based on the attributes it has.

When styling a text input, we generally would not want the same styles to apply to a checkbox. If we target `input` that will happen.

We could add a class to the elements we want to style, however attribute selectors can help us precisely pick the elements we want to style and mean we can avoid adding a class just for this purpose.

The two elements below are a form element with input type of text, which will create a text input field, and checkbox creating a checkbox. As you can see they both use the input element.

```html
<input type="text" name="fName" id="fName" />
<input type="checkbox" name="fTerms" id="fTerms" value="true" />
```

To select and style only the text input we use an attribute selector, adding the attribute and value inside the square brackets.

```css
input[type="text"]
```

The above selector will only match if the attribute and value is exactly type=‚Äútext‚Äù. You can get far more complicated with attribute selectors.

**Select an attribute name**
In our example above our selector would match an attribute name of type with the exact value of text. If we just wanted to select every input element that had a type attribute, regardless of value we could use.

```css
input[type]
```

**Selecting a value that starts with a string**
You can select on values that start, end and contains a specific substring. To match all links that start with ‚Äòhttps‚Äô we would use the selector:

```css
a[href^="https"]
```

To match `http` AND `https` links:

```css
a[href^="http"]
```

To match only links to items on the same page:

```css
a[href^="#"]
```

**Selecting a value that ends with a string**
You can also select a value if it ends with a certain string. This selector would only select links that end in .com.

```css
a[href$=".com"]
```

**Selecting a value that contains a string**
The selector above selecting links that end in `.com` wouldn‚Äôt catch a link that went to another page of the site, or if a `/` was entered at the end of the domain. To catch all of these use a substring match.

```css
a[href*=".com"]
```

This selector would match all of the following elements.

```html
<a href="http://example.com"></a>
<a href="http://example.com/"></a>
<a href="http://example.com/page.html"></a>
```

**Case insensitivity**
By default all of the matches are case sensitive. If you need to make any match case insensitive use the `i` operator before the closing bracket.
This selector would match values starting with `http` or `HTTP` or `Http` for that matter!

```css
a[href^="http" i]
```

**Select a value or a value followed by a** `**-**`
A use case for this is in selecting language subcodes. This selector would match `en-US` and `en-GB`.

```css
span[lang|="en"]
```

# Pseudo-class Selectors

You are likely to be familiar with at least two pseudo-class selectors, the ones we use for selecting the states of a link.

```css
a:link {
}
a:visited {
}
```

These selectors work by acting as if they added a class depending on the state of the link. In this case whether the link is visited or unvisited.
The other pseudo-classes we might use for a link are actually _dynamic_ pseudo-classes. They apply based on something that happens in the document. A link being hovered over, tabbed to or activated.

```css
a:hover {
}
a:active {
}
a:focus {
}
```

To use a pseudo-class we append it to the element we want to target with a colon `:`.

We have several other useful pseudo-classes to play with.

**:first-child**
_Target an element when it is the first child of a parent._

The `first-child` selector was part of CSS2.1. In this example we have a set of paragraphs.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <p>Paragraph one.</p>
  <p>Paragraph two.</p>
</div>
```

To only apply CSS to the first paragraph inside `wrapper` we use the first-child selector.

```css
.wrapper p:first-child {
}
```

This only works if there is a paragraph element as the first element directly inside that container. If we add a level one heading here then the `first-child` selector will no longer select the paragraph.

**:last-child**
_Target an element when it is the last child of a parent._
The Selectors Level 3 specification brought us some new pseudo-class selectors. The last-child selector is just like first-child except it targets the last child of the parent.

```css
.wrapper p:last-child {
}
```

It can be handy to achieve things such as removing the bottom border from a list, or the margin from the final element.

**:nth-child**
_Select multiple elements according to their position in the document tree._

The nth-child selector is very useful indeed. A simple example is to use this selector to stripe table rows.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Favourite colour</th>
    <th>Favourite animal</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rachel</td>
    <td>Purple</td>
    <td>Cat</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Joe</td>
    <td>Pink</td>
    <td>Albatross</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eloise</td>
    <td>Green</td>
    <td>Slug</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

We can apply CSS to the odd rows with the following selector.

```css
tr:nth-child(odd) {
}
```

Or the even rows:

```css
tr:nth-child(even) {
}
```

These keywords are not the only way to use nth-child. We can target a specific row. This selector would _only_ select row 2.

```css
tr:nth-child(2) {
}
```

The keyword value ‚Äòodd‚Äô is equal to this selector, in which we select the first element and every second element after that.

```css
tr:nth-child(2n + 1) td {
}
```

There are some excellent resources to help you get your head around how nth-child works. Rather than reproduce all of that here take a look at:

- [CSS Tricks - How nth-child works](https://css-tricks.com/how-nth-child-works/)
- [nth-test](http://nth-test.com/)

**:nth-of-type**
_Select multiple elements according to their position in the document tree BUT only those elements that are the same as the type the rule is applied to._

Once you have wrapped your head around how nth-child works you can use the same syntax for `nth-of-type`. This selector selects only those elements that are the same type as the element it is applied to.

To apply CSS to every other paragraph but ignore the headings we could use the following selector.

```css
p:nth-of-type(odd) {
}
```

**:only-child**
The `only-child` pseudo-class will match if the element is the only child of the parent - for example a list with only one list item.

```css
li:only-child {
}
```

This can be a useful selector when designing around variable amounts of content coming from a CMS.

**:empty**
The `empty` pseudo-class will match if an element is completely empty or just contains an HTML comment.

```css
p:empty {
}
```

It will not match if there is whitespace inside the element.

```html
<p></p>
<p><!-- a comment --></p>
<p></p>
```

The `empty` pseudo-class would match the first two, but not the last paragraph.

**:not**
The `not` pseudo-class allows you to do something if a selector does not match. The selector you wish to exclude goes inside the round braces. In the below example we make the font bold if it is not inside a `td` with a class of `animal`.

```css
td:not(.animal) {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## :is pseudo-class function

The :is() CSS pseudo-class function takes a selector list as its argument, and selects any element that can be selected by one of the selectors in that list. This is useful for writing large selectors in a more compact form.

It is especially useful if you have many repeating selectors, for example, to target parapgraphs inside `header` and `main` and `footer` and `article`:

```css
:-webkit-any(header, main, footer, article) p:hover {
  color: red;
  cursor: pointer;
}

:-moz-any(header, main, footer, article) p:hover {
  color: red;
  cursor: pointer;
}

:matches(header, main, footer, article) p:hover {
  color: red;
  cursor: pointer;
}

:is(header, main, footer, article) p:hover {
  color: red;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

# Pseudo-element Selectors

Pseudo-elements in CSS2.1 started with a single colon `:`, just like pseudo-classes. In Level 3 of the specification they are described using a double colon `::` to distinguish them. Modern browsers support both in most cases, exceptions are:

- The `::selection` pseudo-element always starts with `::`
- Internet Explorer 8 does not support the `::` syntax for the selectors it supports

I am using the `::` syntax here, but you will see examples on the web using `:`and you might choose to use the single colon syntax if you need to ensure support for older versions of Internet Explorer.

**::first-letter**
_The first character of the first line of text._
The `first-letter` pseudo-element is a good place to start to see how these selectors work.
If we want to style the first letter of a paragraph without using a pseudo-element we would need to wrap it in a span. For example.

```html
<p class="intro"><span>H</span>ello, World!</p>
.intro span { font-size: 200%; }
```

The first-letter selector targets that first-letter without the need of the span. However it acts just as if a virtual span or other element were added.

```html
<p class="intro">Hello, World!</p>
.intro::first-letter { font-size: 200%; }
```

All of our virtual elements act in the same way as first-letter.

**::first-line**
_The first formatted line of text._

The `first-line` pseudo-element selects the first formatted line of text.

```html
<p class="intro">...</p>
.intro::first-line { font-size: 200%; font-weight: bold; color: red; }
```

The `first-line` pseudo-element gives us something better than just wrapping the ‚Äúfirst line‚Äù in a span. When we add that span we would be taking a guess as to what the first line actually was. In a fluid layout and with the user able to increase their font size, the first line could have more or fewer words on it than we imagine. Using first-line means that we will always get the first line - no matter how short or long that line is.

**::before and ::after**
The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements give us the ability to insert _generated content_ before and after another element.

As a simple example we can use `::before` and `::after` to add text before and after a paragraph.

```html
<p class="story">This is my very short story.</p>
.story::before { content: "Once upon a time,"; }
```

```css
.story::after {
  content: "The End.";
}
```

Here we use the content property with a value of the string we wish to insert into our document before or after the element the precedes our pseudo-element.

You can style the generated content with CSS, for example to make the content before and after display on their own lines and in italic we could do this:

```css
.story::before {
  content: "Once upon a time.";
  display: block;
  font-style: italic;
}

.story::after {
  content: "The end.";
  display: block;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

# Selectors Usage Tips

We‚Äôve taken a look at some interesting CSS selectors that allow you to have great control over parts of your document. Here are some final thoughts regarding using these selectors on real projects and the future of CSS Selectors.

## Selectors Level 4

The selectors we have looked at so far have been those that are part of [Selectors Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/), which is a W3C Recommendation.

These selectors have [excellent browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sel3) unless you need to have a high level of support for Internet Explorer 8. Even in that case selectors are relatively easy to polyfill. For support of very old IE you can use tools such as [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com/).

There is a new specification in draft stage for [Selectors Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/). This draft includes existing selectors - just as Level 3 includes the selectors from previous versions of CSS - but adds new selectors.

Of particular interest to layout are the proposals for [Grid Structural Pseudo-classes](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors/#table-pseudos).

Currently there is little in the way of browser support for Level 4 selectors. If you want to read about some of the new selectors proposed as part of that spec you can take a look at [this article on SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/future-generation-css-selectors-level-4/).

## Should we add a class or use a complex selector?

As you have seen, it‚Äôs quite possible to have a large amount of control over selecting elements in your document and applying styles to them. So should you be trying to avoid adding classes to documents and using these selectors instead?

As with most things, the answer is _it depends_. However there are a few things you might like to think about.

Selecting an element depending on document context can be very useful. For example, perhaps you have a blog and each blog post is inside an `article`element with a class of `post`. You could use complex selectors to add the finishing touches to your typography, without needing to add classes within the body of the post. Things like:

Making the paragraph that comes after the main heading larger.

```css
.post h1 + p {
  font-size: 120%;
}
```

Removing a large top margin when headings are stacked.

```css
.post h2 + h3 {
  margin-top: 0;
}
```

This visual styling is tied to the context of a blog post, it makes sense to do that in the CSS. You get the added benefit of not needing to find a way to add classes to your blog posts (and to remember to do that) so visual consistency and speed of editing the content is maintained. You also don‚Äôt end up with classes in your document that are purely for presentation purposes, and that make no sense if the content is also displayed somewhere else.

Selectors such as `nth-child`, `first-child` and `last-child` can be very useful in layout. Being able to detect that you are displaying the last column and then remove the right margin for example. Or in a responsive design, doing something every second item at one breakpoint and every third item at another. These are things that wouldn‚Äôt be possible just by adding classes as they depend on the current state of the document and how it is being viewed.

Where selecting elements based on their location in the document makes less sense is when you want to make reusable components. For example we would add a class to a div that was containing something like a media element, rather than try and pick it out based on location. We might of course use a more complex selector to target things _inside_ that container.

If you find you are creating very long chains of selectors that is usually a sign that you would do well to take a look at your CSS and see if you make more reusable components from elements in your site. These complex selectors can make your life much easier, but overuse can create complicated and hard to re-use CSS.
