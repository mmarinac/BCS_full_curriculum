# "calc()"

The `calc()` property enables calculations to happen right within your CSS instead of doing the math elsewhere and copying the values into our layout.

The `calc()` function is very useful where you have some absolute width items that you want to account for in your layout. It is supported in all modern browsers up from Internet Explorer 9.

## Example of usage:

	width: calc(80% - 30px);
