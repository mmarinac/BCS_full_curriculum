> Please enable 'watch' for the js_curricuum repo by clicking on the bell icon in the top right corner of https://gitlab.com/gk3000/js_curriculum and selecting 'Watch' so that every time we will update the curriculum and push changes you will know and pull them from your laptop by running `git pull` from `js_curriculum` folder.

Please install:

- Google Chrome as we are going to use [Dev Tools](https://developer.Chrome.com/DevTools) extensively.

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your laptop. Please choose LTS version.

- Git [GitBash on Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)

> Once you have Git installed in your Terminal (Mac) or GitBash (Windows) run `git config --global init.defaultBranch main` to set up the default branch to `main`, [here is why](https://barcelonacodeschool.com/changing-default-git-branch-to-main)

GitLab:

- Create an account at [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up).
- You will get an invitation to join Barcelona Code School team and access to any private repos, including [BCS_JS_BOOTCAMP_FILES_TDD_STUDENTS_VERSION](https://gitlab.com/gk3000/BCS_JS_BOOTCAMP_FILES_TDD.git) with course exercises file structure and testing modules.
- First you will need to fork it on GitLab (click "Fork" button in the top right corner) to make your own copy of the exercises platform
- Then clone this forked version from under your account to your local disk drive. So after forking on Gitlab.com go to your Terminal (on Mac) or GitBash (on Windows) and do:

  `git clone URL_OF_your_own_forked_repo`

> Remember, every time you finished a block or section of the curriculum you will need to push it back to your GitLab account and we will fetch it from there.

Resources:

- Use ["Issues"](https://gitlab.com/gk3000/BCS_JS_BOOTCAMP_FILES_TDD/issues) section of repo with the exercises to send all your questions related to the exercises/projects and browse through the questions/answers posted by the students form the previous cohorts.

- Use (but please don't abuse) the ["Wikis"](https://gitlab.com/gk3000/BCS_JS_BOOTCAMP_FILES_TDD/wikis) section of the exercises repo to get hints and steps for the JS exercises if you are stuck.

- Reading list, extra materials are in the section called 'Materials and resources' in the sidebar on the left.

- Video lessons: [here is the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLryb4nu66MZcb_LqLyWo-KuVEltlOZ7nc) for the video lessons we have prepared for you. They normally follow the same materials we have in the text lectures. Good idea to watch them after going through the text version of a lecture.

<!-- # Live lectures
[Here is the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLryb4nu66MZfrDQWBqR57YswtPg2u1RCz) with the recording of live lectures. We add the new one along the way and they would appear in the bottom of the playlist. As the live lectures take longer than screencasts please only watch them if you have time and need to revisit the particular topic.

NB: Remember, that first you use the text materials form this repo, second â€“ watch the video lessons, they are prepared specifically to have the most essential explanations, demos, etc., thus they are more efficient. And only after that if you want to watch more explanations use live lectures. They are normally longer and covering exactly the same materials.   -->

## Week 1:
1. Complete at least [cloning projects #1 and #2](js_cur/_html/Projects.md)

	Portfolio examples:
	* http://josharnott.surge.sh
	* http://annachew.surge.sh
	* https://saramoya.gitlab.io/my-portfolio/
	* http://gerviebarczyk.com/
	* https://gabriellatavares.surge.sh/

	Or, later with react you can even do something like this:
	* https://bruno-simon.com/
	* http://rleonardi.com/

To do so please use HTML and CSS section from the curriculum. In CSS section every concept is shown with working examples of related HTML and CSS code.

## Week 2:
