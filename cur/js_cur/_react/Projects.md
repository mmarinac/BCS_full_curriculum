# 8. Zolzar game 

### Intergalactic battle

Create a game which will simulate a battle between people and aliens. 

You start with 5 different units for each army and each unit has 2 parameters:
- power, meaning how hard they can hit
- rate, meaning how fast they can hit

Define initial amount of each units, for example 1000.

There are 3 locations: Earth, Moon, Zolzar. The game starts on Earth, if people's army wins then next battle is on the Moon, if people win next battle is on Zolzar. If people loose the battle, next one is back on Moon or Earth. 

If any army looses battle on their home planet -- game over. 

For every battle each army can have 3 units with same amount of each, let's say 100. You need to decide a winner based on combined power, rate and total number of units. Same during each battle the units fight each other in the matching order, so unit #1 from people's army fights unit #1 from alien's army, etc. The winning unit is counted by combined power, rate and quantity. The unit which looses battle perishes entirely, the winning unit looses a certain amount of unit member which is calculated based on the damage the opposite unit causes. 

For every battle won the player can receive bonuses like new units and/pr upgrades. 

If one army runs out of unit members it looses the war. 

Add eCommerce component where you can 
â€“ buy units if they perish
â€“ unlock upgrades and bonuses

Use user accounts to keep progress and purchases. 

For a guest game all the purchases apply only for this current session.

Option 1: Chat with users, similar to the one we have at barcelonacodeschool.com. There is an admin who can login to the website and guests, who see the chat module. Every guest can chat only with an admin, and the admin can chat to every client.

Option 2: Users chat -- after user signs up and login they can see a list of all users and they can invite them to chat, the other user can accept or decline. Users can also â€˜friendâ€™ other users. Extra feature â€” group chats.
