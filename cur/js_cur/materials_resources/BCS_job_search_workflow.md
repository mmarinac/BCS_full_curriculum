# Landing a job preparation workflow

## GitLab

* Make sure to add your contact info into your GitLab account so there is a way to get in touch with you
* Push your code to GitLab
* Each project is a separate repo
* Each repo has a README.MD with a clear description of your project:
	* What this project does
	* What stack/tools you used to build it
	* Highlight any challenges/solutions you are especially proud of for this project
	* How to test run you project -> detailed instructions (how to clone and run you project)

## Portfolio

* Host it on either Surge, GitLab Pages or on any hosting of your
choice
* Present yourself as a developer with focus on your skills and stack first
* Add links to the projects you want to showcase: GitLab account or individual repos and
deployed projects available online
* Give some personal info

CV
* Follow the examples we've shared for the structure of your CV:
	* Name and contact details on top
	* List of skills, languages you speak and education section on the left
	* List of projects built during the bootcamp on the right with main functionality and used
	tools and links to the repos/deployed projects

Once you finished these send them to [office@barcelonacodeschool.com](mailto:office@barcelonacodeschool.com):

1. Link to your GitLab
2. CV
3. Portfolio page

The sooner we have them the better. We will check them first and give you some feedback if
something needed to be improved.

After that we will start sending your profiles accompanied by the recommendation letter to our hiring
partners and they will get in touch with you directly.

Examples of GitLab accounts and portfolio pages we find appealing for the
recruiters:

[Paul](https://github.com/pzhine?tab=repositories) - check how clean and useful the
README.MD files are ([here](https://github.com/pzhine/inyourland) and [here](https://github.com/pzhine/qualendar-api) )

[Peter](http://pnagy.github.io) - check how he presents his coding skills making it obvious about the level of expertise with each of them and the working experience section: what company did and what he
did exactly
